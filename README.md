# IoTVisualizer
Recently, they have been issued a business challenge to help visualize a factory's shop floor IoT readouts for better understanding of why issues arise.
 
Traditionally reporting would occur in a dashboard. However we are interested in exploring this opportunity further by actually visualizing the report output via mixed reality. Viewing the readouts of embedded IoT devices in plant machinery provides a environmental perspective to understanding shop floor problems.
 
Problems such as heat duct exhaust dispensing on plant machinery or even people space and traffic could be visualized alongside IoT data to better address problems on the shop floor.

<b>HOW IT WILL WORK / HOW IT WILL BE BUILT</b>
1. Capture readouts from IoT devices on a shop floor
2. Dynamically assign IoT device placement on a mixed reality plane
3. Create a functional report output visible in mixed reality in correlation with the factory’s shop floor
4. Publish integration guidance of mixed reality, Machine Learning / Cognitive Service and IoT Suite on GitHub for community adoption
